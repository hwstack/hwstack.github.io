Features:
=========

####Adding Tasks
----------------
Fill out the "_#class_" and "_task & date_" inputs and press enter (alternatively, you can press the plus symbol to the right of the inputs).

####Editing Tasks
-----------------
Click on the pencil icon to the right of the task, and the info will appear in the input boxes.  As long as the "_#class_" input stays the same, whatever is in the "_task & date_" input will overwrite the old info.  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot have more than one task block per key.  Fortunately, there are two solutions:

1. Put **multiple tasks** in the same task block ```Prepare for Crisis #4<br>Study WWW Lists 1-5```
2. Create **multiple "keys."** ```"#HumCad1", "#HumCad2", etc.```

_Note:_ ```<br>``` creates a line break.  For example, ```Prepare for Crisis #4<br>Study WWW Lists 1-5``` becomes
>Prepare for Crisis #4<br>Study WWW Lists 1-5

####Adding Tasks from theStack
------------------------------
Simply click on any class hashtag or task info from **theStack** and it will appear in the "_#class_" or "_task & date_" input.

###Note:
You can use **HTML** code in the "_#class_" and "_task & date_" inputs.  If you don't know what the heck I'm talking about, it's ok. For those interested, [looky here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp "nothing scary").
