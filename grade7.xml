		<task>Read chapters 32-35 in AHF.  Answer the following questions:
			1.  What are your first impressions of the Phelps farm and especially, Aunt Sally?  Is she a kind or a callous person?  Why do you think this?  (textual evidence)
			2.  What sort of person is Uncle Silas?
			3.  Do you find anything chilling or upsetting about these people?
			4.  Jim has had many opportunities to leave Huck, but he stays.  Why do you think he did?  Did it serve him well to stay?
			5.  Tom and Huck come up with their own plans to free Jim.  What do you think of Huck’s plan?  Of Tom’s?  You will see that the implementation of Tom’s plan is hilariously funny, but what is disturbing about this plan?</task>
