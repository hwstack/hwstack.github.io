=================

hwstack: a new tasks system.

goal: with only two (and a half) people, we can easily get all of the hw tasks for the whole grade. putting these on a nice website (thanks for the css, jacob) will make for a good task system.

Q: why shouldn't i just use google tasks?

A: what if you mess it up? what if you forget a task? for some, gtasks is reliable -- for others, not so much.
=================

Q: what happened to mytasks?

A: jacob was using kitchen utensils with the git, it went down. hwstack replaced it.
=================

Q: will hwstack ever be down?

A: shouldn't be, as long as github is up.
=================

Q: how do i know hwstack has all of my hw tasks?

A: look at the due dates, if something's missing (nothing should be) then tell one of us. we're working on a (possibly php) submission system to add tasks, which we verify.
=================

Q: what classes can benefit from hwstack?

A: humanities c and v, science, latin, and math k (math c coming soon!).
=================

Q: will hwstack ever have model un tasks?

A: i'm trying to get jacob to let me.
=================

Q: why did you make this readme file? i can see you in person at school, you know.

A: my body my rules. (wtf? -jc)
